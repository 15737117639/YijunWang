### I am making changes to Model 1: Estimation of R0: To do:
- mathmatical proof (latex)
- point out the limitation: p value is true parameter value
- major conclusion: after 1.23 Wuhan lockdown, R0 keeps rising due to 5 million people left Wuhan and quarantine at home causes infection from within family unit. However, the declining of R0 recently shows the effectiveness of government policy: social and non-pharmaceutical prevention.

### I have written model 2 SEIR to estimate the outbreak size and time in major cities in China. I haven't cleaned up the code yet and will do as soon as I finished model 1.
