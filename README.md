### I am making changes to Model 1: Estimation of R0: To do:
- mathmatical proof (latex)
- limitation: p value is the true parameter value
- major conclusion: after 1.23 Wuhan lockdown, R0 keeps rising due to 5 million people left Wuhan and quarantine at home causes infection from within family unit. However, the declining of R0 recently shows the effectiveness of government policy: social and non-pharmaceutical prevention
- sensitivity analysis (table)
- confidence interval or alternative Tg value?
### Model 2 is in progress
